# Aurora: Minimal Deep Learning Library.

Aurora is a minimal deep learning library written in Python/Numpy and a bit of C++. It was designed to construct simple deep learning systems such as simple MLP. The current version comes with following features.

* Automatic differentiation using static computational graphs.
* Shape inference.
* Static memory allocation for efficient training and inference.
