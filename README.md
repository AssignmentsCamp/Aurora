# Aurora: Minimal Deep Learning Library.

Aurora is a minimal deep learning library written in Python/Numpy and a bit of C++. It was designed to construct simple deep learning systems such as simple MLP. The current version comes with following features.

* Automatic differentiation using static computational graphs.
* Shape inference.
* Static memory allocation for efficient training and inference.
* Support both GPU (using Nvidia CUDA) and numpy.

Tough Aurora in a minimal deep learning system, it is quite capable of building MLPs for real-world datasets such as MINST and CIFAR-10. 

### Limitations

The current version comes with following limitations. We will be addressing those limitations in upcoming releases.

* Convolutional operators.
* cuDNN support.
* Model checkpointing.
* Multi-GPU and distributed training.
